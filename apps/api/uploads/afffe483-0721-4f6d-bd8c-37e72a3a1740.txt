JOHN
Hello, Mary! How are you doing today?

MARY
I'm doing well, thanks! How about you?

JOHN
I've been thinking about our conversation yesterday.

MARY
What about it?

JOHN
I think we should talk more about our plans for the future.

MARY
I agree. We have a lot to discuss.

(They sit down at the table)

JOHN
Where should we start?

MARY
Let's start with our dreams and see where they lead us.
