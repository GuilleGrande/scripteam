## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- User flow documentation should include error scenarios and recovery paths
- Integration testing requirements need more specific criteria for AI API reliability

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Consider adding more detailed data schema requirements for progress tracking
- Add specific guidance on handling script copyright compliance

**LOW Priority:**
- Consider adding more specific UI component requirements for design consistency
- Add guidance on customer support escalation procedures

## MVP Scope Assessment
- **Scope is Appropriate:** Epic 1 delivers core value validation within 4-6 weeks
- **No Features Should Be Cut:** All Epic 1 features are essential for hypothesis validation
- **No Missing Essential Features:** Core AI voice synthesis and script analysis are well-covered
- **Complexity Concerns:** AI API integration represents highest technical risk but is well-planned with fallback strategies
- **Timeline Realism:** 4-6 weeks for Epic 1 is achievable with focused development

## Technical Readiness
- **Technical Constraints:** Well-defined with clear rationale for React Native, Node.js, and AWS choices
- **Identified Technical Risks:** AI API costs, voice quality standards, real-time performance - all documented with mitigation strategies
- **Architect Investigation Needed:** Pre-processing architecture for scene audio generation, AI API failover strategies

## Recommendations

**For Epic 1 Success:**
1. Prioritize AI API testing early to validate voice quality assumptions
2. Build AI cost monitoring from Day 1 to prevent budget overruns
3. Focus on script parsing accuracy testing with diverse script formats

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. Design scalable pre-processing pipeline for scene audio generation
2. Plan robust AI API integration with automatic failover
3. Consider data architecture for user progress and script management

**For Future Refinement:**
1. Develop detailed user journey maps for onboarding and error scenarios
2. Expand integration testing framework for AI service reliability
3. Add specific compliance guidance for script copyright handling

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The scope is well-balanced for MVP validation while providing clear technical guidance for implementation.
