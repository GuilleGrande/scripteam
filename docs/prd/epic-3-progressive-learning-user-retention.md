3. Adaptive hiding patterns (keywords first, then full lines, then entire speeches)
4. Manual override controls for user-directed difficulty adjustment
5. Visual cues and assistance levels that decrease with skill progression

## Story 3.2 Performance Analytics and Feedback
As a drama student,
I want detailed feedback on my practice sessions,
so that I can identify areas for improvement and track skill development.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Session completion rates and consistency metrics
2. Difficulty progression tracking across different scripts and characters
3. Practice frequency analysis with recommendations for optimal training
4. Comparative performance across different character types and scenes
5. Weekly/monthly progress reports with actionable insights

## Story 3.3 Advanced Audio Controls and Voice Customization
As a drama student,
I want to customize AI character voices and interaction patterns,
so that I can create optimal practice conditions for different scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Voice characteristic adjustment (age, accent, emotional tone) for each character
2. Emotional intensity calibration based on scene context and stage directions
3. Response timing controls to practice with different scene partner styles
4. Voice comparison mode to test different interpretations
5. Save custom voice settings for reuse across multiple practice sessions

## Story 3.4 Educational Features and Learning Paths
As a drama student,
I want structured learning paths and educational content,
so that I can systematically develop my acting skills beyond just script practice.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Suggested practice routines based on user skill level and goals
2. Character development exercises with AI-guided interactions
3. Emotional range expansion activities using voice tone variations
4. Scene analysis tools that highlight dramatic beats and relationship dynamics
5. Integration with common acting methodologies and techniques

## Story 3.5 Social Features and Community Integration
As a drama student,
I want to connect with other actors and share practice experiences,
so that I can learn from peers and stay motivated in my development.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Practice group creation for class projects and scene partnerships
2. Progress sharing and friendly competition features
3. Community challenges and group practice goals
4. Peer feedback and commentary on practice sessions
