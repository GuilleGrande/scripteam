## Strategy Rationale

### Why Web-First Approach?
1. **âš¡ Immediate Validation**: Working PoC in days, not weeks
2. **ðŸ’° Cost Efficiency**: Reuse existing API backend completely
3. **ðŸ§ª User Testing**: Validate core hypothesis before mobile investment
4. **ðŸ”„ Strategic Flexibility**: Choose optimal mobile framework based on learnings

### Why Flutter for Mobile Phase?
1. **ðŸ“± True Single Codebase**: iOS + Android + Web + Desktop from one codebase
2. **ðŸŽ¨ UI Consistency**: Pixel-perfect control across all platforms
3. **âš¡ Native Performance**: Compiled native code, not web wrapper
4. **ðŸ”® Future-Proof**: Google-backed, fastest-growing mobile framework
