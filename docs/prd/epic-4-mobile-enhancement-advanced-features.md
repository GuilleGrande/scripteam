2. Document scanner integration for physical script digitization
3. File organization system with folders and tags
4. Bulk import functionality for script libraries
5. File sharing capabilities with other users
6. Auto-backup to cloud storage
7. File format conversion (PDF to text, image to text via OCR)
8. Integration with email attachments and messaging apps

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Story 4.2 Offline Script Processing
As a drama student,
I want to process and practice scripts without internet connection,
so that I can rehearse anywhere regardless of connectivity.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Local AI processing for character detection when offline
2. Voice synthesis caching with intelligent preloading
3. Offline script analysis and scene segmentation
4. Local storage management with cleanup options
5. Sync capabilities when connectivity returns
6. Offline progress tracking and session recording
7. Battery-optimized offline processing
8. Clear indicators of offline vs online capabilities

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Story 4.3 Native Mobile UI/UX Patterns
As a drama student,
I want a mobile interface that feels native and intuitive,
so that I can focus on acting without learning new interaction patterns.
