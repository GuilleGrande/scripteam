# Epic 3: Flutter Migration - Mobile Foundation

**Epic Goal:** Migrate proven web functionality to Flutter for true single-codebase mobile experience across iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop platforms.

## Phase 2 Strategy Context
This epic begins Phase 2 of the architecture strategy, transitioning from web PoC validation to production-ready mobile application:
- **Input:** Validated web PoC with user feedback and proven value proposition
- **Output:** Cross-platform mobile application with feature parity
- **Technology:** Flutter for true single-codebase across all platforms

## Story 3.1 Flutter Project Setup and Architecture
As a development team,
I want a properly configured Flutter project with clean architecture,
so that we can migrate web functionality efficiently and maintain code quality.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Flutter project initialized with proper folder structure and dependencies
2. State management solution implemented (Riverpod or Bloc pattern)
3. API client layer compatible with existing Express.js backend
4. Cross-platform build configuration for iOS, Android, Web, Desktop
5. Development environment setup with hot reload and debugging
6. CI/CD pipeline configuration for multi-platform builds
7. Code generation setup for models and API clients
8. Testing framework configuration (unit, widget, integration tests)

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Story 3.2 ScriptUpload Component Migration to Flutter
As a drama student,
I want to upload script files through the mobile app interface,
so that I can access ScripTeam functionality on my mobile device.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. File picker integration supporting PDF and text files on all platforms
2. Drag-and-drop functionality where platform supported (Web, Desktop)
3. Native file system integration for mobile platforms
4. Upload progress indication with cancellation capability
5. File validation and error handling matching web PoC functionality
6. Cross-platform storage management for uploaded files
7. Offline capability for previously uploaded scripts
8. File size optimization for mobile data constraints

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Story 3.3 Cross-Platform Voice Synthesis Integration
As a drama student,
I want AI character voices to work seamlessly across all platforms,
so that I can practice scenes regardless of my device.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. ElevenLabs API integration working on iOS, Android, Web, Desktop
2. Audio playback system optimized for each platform
3. Voice caching strategy adapted for mobile storage constraints
4. Offline voice playback for downloaded content
5. Platform-specific audio optimizations (iOS AVAudioSession, Android AudioManager)
6. Background audio capability for long practice sessions
7. Bluetooth headphone compatibility and controls
8. Voice quality consistency across platforms

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Story 3.4 Mobile-Optimized User Interface
As a drama student,
I want a mobile interface optimized for touch interaction,
so that I can practice effectively on small screens without losing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Responsive UI design adapting to screen sizes from phone to desktop
2. Touch-optimized controls for practice session management
3. Gesture-based navigation (swipe, pinch, tap patterns)
4. Mobile-first information architecture prioritizing key actions
5. Dark mode support for low-light practice environments
6. Accessibility compliance (screen readers, high contrast)
7. Platform-specific UI patterns (Material Design, Cupertino, Fluent)
8. Landscape and portrait orientation support

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Story 3.5 Mobile Performance Optimization
As a drama student,
I want the mobile app to perform smoothly without draining battery,
so that I can practice for extended periods on my mobile device.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. App startup time under 3 seconds on mid-range devices
2. Memory usage optimized for mobile constraints
3. Battery usage optimization for voice playback and processing
4. Network usage optimization with intelligent caching
5. Background processing management for iOS/Android
6. Performance profiling and monitoring integration
7. Gradual loading for large scripts on mobile connections
8. Device storage management with cleanup capabilities

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

## Epic Success Criteria
- [ ] Flutter app deployed to iOS App Store and Google Play Store
- [ ] Feature parity with web PoC achieved across all platforms
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met on target device range
- [ ] User testing confirms mobile experience meets expectations
- [ ] Single codebase maintainability validated
- [ ] Foundation ready for Epic 4 advanced mobile features

## Dependencies
- Epic 1: Core AI functionality validated
- Epic 2: Web PoC user feedback and optimization complete
- Backend API: No changes required (designed for frontend agnostic)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Flutter learning curve impacts timeline
- **Mitigation:** Parallel Flutter training during Epic 2 development
- **Risk:** Platform-specific audio issues
- **Mitigation:** Platform-specific testing and fallback strategies
- **Risk:** App store approval delays
- **Mitigation:** Early compliance review and beta testing

## Migration Strategy
1. **Parallel Development:** Begin Flutter setup during Epic 2 completion
2. **Component-by-Component:** Migrate web components systematically
3. **API Compatibility:** Maintain existing backend without changes
4. **Testing-First:** Establish testing before feature migration
5. **Progressive Rollout:** Beta testing before public release
