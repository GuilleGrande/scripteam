# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable drama students and early-career actors to practice scenes with character-specific AI voices, eliminating the constraint of partner availability
- Create an affordable alternative to €40-80/hour private coaching sessions through AI-powered scene partner simulation
- Deliver measurable skill development through progressive difficulty systems that adapt from full script visibility to advanced "blackout mode"
- Establish ScripTeam as the leading "AI Acting Coach" category creator with 80%+ brand awareness in target demographic by Year 2
- Achieve €50K-150K revenue in Year 1 (Spain market) scaling to €500K-1.5M by Year 3 through European expansion
- Build sustainable user base of 500-1,500 active users in Year 1, reaching 5,000-15,000 users by Year 3
- Integrate with 5-10 drama schools/conservatories in Spain by end of Year 1, expanding to 25-50 institutions across EU by Year 3

## Background Context
ScripTeam addresses a fundamental practice paradox in acting education: while scene work requires interactive dialogue with partners to develop timing, emotional responses, and character dynamics, partners are rarely available when needed. Market research reveals that 40% of actors (6,000-8,000 in Spain alone) are drama students or early-career professionals who cannot afford expensive private coaching and struggle with scheduling conflicts for peer practice.

The post-COVID shift toward remote auditions and self-tape submissions has intensified the need for solo practice tools, while AI voice technology has reached sufficient quality for character simulation. Unlike existing solutions that focus on line memorization (ColdRead, Rehearsal Pro), ScripTeam creates character-specific AI voices that respond with appropriate personality, tone, and emotional calibration based on script analysis and stage directions.
