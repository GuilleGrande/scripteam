# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, actor-focused mobile experience that feels like having a professional scene partner always available. The interface should reduce friction between script upload and practice session start, emphasizing quick access to core functionality while maintaining the serious, professional tone that appeals to drama students and early-career actors.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Voice-First Interaction:** Primary interface during practice sessions relies on voice commands and audio cues rather than touch, allowing actors to focus on performance
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Interface complexity adapts to user skill level, hiding advanced features initially and revealing them as actors become more comfortable
- **Gesture-Based Session Control:** Simple swipe/tap gestures for pause, replay, and difficulty adjustment during practice without breaking immersion
- **Quick Access Patterns:** One-tap access to recent scripts and favorite practice sessions from home screen

## Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:
- **Script Upload & Analysis Screen:** Drag-and-drop interface with real-time parsing progress and character detection results
- **Character Selection Screen:** Visual character cards showing detected roles with voice preview options
- **Practice Session Screen:** Minimal interface during active practice with script text, audio controls, and progress indicators
- **Progress Dashboard:** Visual skill progression tracking with session history and achievement milestones
- **Settings & Profile Screen:** Voice preferences, difficulty settings, and account management

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target WCAG AA compliance to support actors with visual or hearing impairments, including screen reader compatibility, high contrast options, and visual indicator alternatives for audio cues.

## Branding
Professional, modern aesthetic that conveys reliability and educational value without appearing overly corporate. Clean typography suitable for script reading, with color palette that supports extended reading sessions and reduces eye strain during practice.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on mobile devices (iOS/Android) with responsive web interface for desktop script upload and management. Progressive Web App capabilities for offline script access.
