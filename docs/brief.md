# Project Brief: ScripTeam

## Executive Summary

**ScripTeam is an AI-powered mobile application that transforms how actors practice scenes by providing character-specific AI voice partners for interactive script rehearsal.** Unlike existing line memorization tools, ScripTeam enables actors to practice with realistic AI voices that respond as different characters, creating an immersive rehearsal experience that simulates having scene partners available anytime, anywhere.

**Primary Problem:** Actors struggle to practice scenes effectively without partners due to scheduling conflicts, geographic constraints, and cost barriers, leading to under-prepared performances and missed opportunities.

**Target Market:** Drama students (16-28), early-career actors (18-35), and acting coaches in Spain and English-speaking European markets, representing a €35M-50M serviceable addressable market.

**Key Value Proposition:** "Practice like you have a scene partner, anytime, anywhere" - combining AI character voices, emotional calibration, and progressive learning to replace expensive private coaching and overcome partner availability constraints.

## Problem Statement

**Current State and Pain Points:**

Actors face a fundamental practice paradox: while scene work requires interactive dialogue with partners to develop timing, emotional responses, and character dynamics, partners are rarely available when needed. Your market research reveals that 40% of actors (6,000-8,000 in Spain alone) are drama students or early-career professionals who cannot afford €40-80/hour private coaching sessions and struggle with scheduling conflicts for peer practice.

**Impact of the Problem (Quantified):**

- **Financial Impact:** Actors spend €15-20M annually on private coaching in Spain, yet still lack on-demand practice access
- **Career Impact:** Under-prepared auditions lead to missed opportunities in an increasingly competitive market where self-tape auditions require solo preparation skills
- **Educational Impact:** Drama students receive limited individual practice time in group classes, hindering skill development progression
- **Time Impact:** Scheduling conflicts with scene partners waste valuable preparation time, especially critical during audition seasons

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

Current acting practice apps focus on line memorization rather than interactive scene work. ColdRead ($6.99-10.99/month) offers voice recognition but uses generic text-to-speech voices that lack character personality. Rehearsal Pro ($19.99 one-time) provides script management but no voice interaction. Free alternatives like YouTube tutorials are passive and non-personalized. None address the core need for character-specific scene partner simulation.

**Urgency and Importance:**

The post-COVID shift toward remote auditions and self-tape submissions has intensified the need for solo practice tools. AI voice technology has reached sufficient quality for character simulation, creating a window of opportunity before larger competitors enter the market. The growing acceptance of AI in creative education (ChatGPT for scriptwriting, AI music composition) indicates market readiness for AI-powered acting tools.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept and Approach:**

ScripTeam transforms script practice through an AI orchestration system that parses screenplays to identify characters, scenes, and emotional contexts, then generates character-specific AI voices for interactive scene rehearsal. The app uses advanced AI workflows (leveraging n8n orchestration) to analyze uploaded scripts and create immersive practice sessions where actors select their character role while AI voices respond as other characters with appropriate personality, tone, and emotional calibration.

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:**

- **Character-Specific AI Voices:** Unlike generic text-to-speech, ScripTeam creates distinct voice personalities for each character based on script analysis and stage directions
- **Emotional Calibration:** AI analyzes scene context and stage directions to deliver lines with appropriate emotional tone and intensity
- **Progressive Learning System:** Difficulty adapts from full script visibility to advanced "blackout mode" as actors improve, with visual cues and assistance levels that decrease over time
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Android and iOS support targets underserved markets (ColdRead is iOS-only)
- **Educational Focus:** Designed for skill development rather than just audition preparation, with progress tracking and learning pathways

**Why This Solution Will Succeed Where Others Haven't:**

Current solutions treat acting as line memorization rather than character interaction. ScripTeam addresses the core need for scene partner simulation by combining three breakthrough capabilities: (1) sophisticated AI voice synthesis that creates believable character personalities, (2) script intelligence that understands dramatic context and relationships, and (3) adaptive learning that grows with the actor's skill level. The solution leverages existing AI APIs (cost-effective for solopreneur) while focusing on acting-specific domain expertise that's difficult for generalist competitors to replicate.

**High-Level Vision for the Product:**

ScripTeam becomes the "AI Acting Coach" that democratizes professional-quality scene practice. Actors upload any script and immediately access a full cast of AI scene partners, practicing with character-appropriate voices that understand dramatic context. The app evolves from basic scene reading to advanced coaching, eventually incorporating celebrity voice options, emotional feedback analytics, and integration with acting education curricula to become the standard practice tool for the next generation of actors.
