# Documentation Audit Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-09-26
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Project Team

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Complete documentation audit to identify gaps after course correction and refactoring

**Session Goals:** Broad exploration of all documentation gaps with no constraints

**Techniques Used:** Question Storming, What If Scenarios, Role Playing

**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ distinct documentation gaps identified

### Key Themes Identified:
- Missing foundational documentation (onboarding, structure, workflows)
- Technical specification gaps across all system components
- AI infrastructure and prompt engineering undocumented
- Real-time feature flows not specified
- Testing and quality assurance documentation absent
- Epic-story alignment issues post-refactoring

## Technique Sessions

### Question Storming - 10 minutes
**Description:** Generated foundational questions to reveal structural gaps

#### Ideas Generated:
1. Do we have a clear architectural picture, what are the main services?
2. How is the system structured and connected?
3. Is the documentation up to date with the code?
4. Are epics and stories aligned?
5. If I go to sleep and return fresh the next day, can I easily pick up work where I left off?

#### Insights Discovered:
- Core architectural questions indicate fundamental documentation structure issues
- Developer continuity concerns reveal missing workflow documentation
- Epic-story alignment directly addressed main concern

### What If Scenarios - 15 minutes
**Description:** Explored documentation gaps through new developer and handover scenarios

#### Ideas Generated:
1. No onboarding documentation exists
2. Documentation structure/navigation unclear
3. Missing developer workflow guidance
4. No service connection definitions
5. Missing OpenAPI specifications
6. No technical specifications
7. Character detection algorithm undocumented
8. Scripted scene orchestration missing
9. No user journeys defined
10. Missing CI/CD implementation instructions
11. Missing C4 diagrams for stakeholder communication
12. Scene practice responsiveness requirements undefined
13. AI voice/user input technical flow undocumented
14. Listener pattern documentation missing
15. Cue detection system not specified
16. No "expected last words" trigger system documentation

#### Insights Discovered:
- New developer scenario revealed systematic onboarding gaps
- Handover scenario exposed critical technical specification voids
- Real-time feature complexity requires detailed technical documentation

### Role Playing (QA Engineer) - 10 minutes
**Description:** Identified testing-specific documentation gaps

#### Ideas Generated:
1. User journeys needed for test case definition
2. Main application components/moving parts not documented
3. Data models need extension to capture findings
4. n8n workflow definitions missing
5. Self-hosted GPT-OSS AI implementation not documented
6. AI use cases not clearly defined
7. Prompt engineering strategies missing
8. BMad agent workflow recommendations needed

#### Insights Discovered:
- QA perspective revealed testing infrastructure documentation gaps
- AI implementation completely undocumented
- Custom tooling (BMad agents) needs usage guidelines

## Action Planning

### Immediate Opportunities (Ready to implement now)

#### 1. Epic-Story Alignment Audit
- **Description:** Matrix comparing current epics vs implemented stories post-refactoring
- **Why immediate:** Directly addresses core concern blocking current planning
- **Resources needed:** PM, PO, lead developer for 1-day workshop
- **Timeline:** Complete within 1 week

#### 2. Developer Onboarding Guide
- **Description:** Basic setup, structure overview, first contribution guide
- **Why immediate:** Blocking new team members and daily productivity
- **Resources needed:** 1-2 days documentation effort from senior developer
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days

#### 3. Create Current Architecture State Documentation
- **Description:** C4 diagrams showing system after refactoring and course corrections
- **Why immediate:** Foundation needed for all other technical documentation
- **Resources needed:** Architecture review session + diagramming tools
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Future Innovations (Requiring development/research)

#### 1. Comprehensive Technical Specifications
- **Description:** OpenAPI specs, algorithm documentation, data models
- **Development needed:** Systematic review of all technical components
- **Timeline estimate:** 3-4 weeks

#### 2. AI Infrastructure Documentation Suite
- **Description:** Complete documentation of n8n workflows, GPT-OSS implementation, prompt engineering
- **Development needed:** Deep technical review and knowledge extraction
- **Timeline estimate:** 2-3 weeks

#### 3. Testing & QA Framework Documentation
- **Description:** User journeys, test case templates, quality benchmarks
- **Development needed:** QA strategy definition and documentation standards
- **Timeline estimate:** 2-3 weeks

### Top 3 Immediate Priorities

#### #1 Priority: Epic-Story Alignment Audit
- **Rationale:** Core concern that's blocking planning and development alignment
- **Next steps:** Schedule cross-functional review, create alignment matrix, identify discrepancies
- **Resources needed:** PM, PO, lead developer, 1 day workshop
- **Timeline:** Complete within 1 week

#### #2 Priority: Architecture Documentation Post-Refactoring
- **Rationale:** Foundation needed for all other technical documentation efforts
- **Next steps:** Architecture review, create C4 diagrams, document service connections
- **Resources needed:** Senior developer, architect, diagramming tools
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

#### #3 Priority: AI Infrastructure Documentation
- **Rationale:** Critical undocumented systems creating high risk for maintenance and development
- **Next steps:** Inventory AI components, document n8n workflows, specify prompt engineering approaches
- **Resources needed:** AI implementation lead, technical writer, system review
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

## Critical Success Factors

### Documentation Maintenance Strategy
- **Integration into development workflow:** Documentation updates as part of definition of done
- **Regular audit cycles:** Quarterly documentation gap reviews
- **Tool integration:** Consider auto-generated documentation where possible

### Quality Metrics
- **Completeness scoring:** Track percentage of components with adequate documentation
- **User feedback:** Regular surveys on documentation usability
- **Maintenance lag:** Monitor time between code changes and documentation updates

## Next Steps

### Week 1: Foundation Setting
1. Complete epic-story alignment audit
2. Begin architecture documentation review
3. Inventory all AI infrastructure components

### Week 2-3: Core Documentation
1. Create C4 diagrams and service connection documentation
2. Document n8n workflows and AI implementations
3. Create developer onboarding guide

### Week 4+: Systematic Gap Closure
1. Begin technical specifications documentation
2. Define and document user journeys
3. Create testing and QA framework documentation

## Follow-up Recommendations

### Next Brainstorming Session
- **Topic:** Documentation maintenance strategy and tooling
- **Timeframe:** 2-3 weeks after initial fixes are underway
- **Preparation:** Review current documentation tools and evaluate automation options

### Additional Exploration Areas
- **Documentation tooling evaluation:** Consider automated documentation generation
- **Security documentation:** May need separate security-focused documentation audit
- **Performance monitoring:** Document observability and monitoring approaches
