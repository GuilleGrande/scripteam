# Tech Stack

This is the **DEFINITIVE technology selection** for the ScripTeam project using a **two-phase approach**: Phase 1 delivers a working web PoC quickly, Phase 2 migrates to single-codebase mobile architecture for maximum long-term value.

## Architecture Strategy: React Web â†’ Flutter Migration

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Web PoC)**: Fast validation with proven React web stack
**Phase 2 (Future - Mobile)**: Migration to Flutter for true single-codebase multiplatform

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Web PoC (Week 1-2) âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… **Backend Infrastructure**: Express.js API fully functional
- âœ… **Frontend**: React web app from Lovable PoC integrated
- âœ… **Infrastructure**: Docker orchestration with hot reloading
- âœ… **Goal**: Complete foundation ready for feature development

### Phase 2: Mobile Migration (Future - TBD)
- ðŸ”„ **Frontend**: Migrate to Flutter
- âœ… **Backend**: No changes required
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Single codebase for iOS/Android/Web/Desktop

## Decision Rationale

### Why React Web First?
1. **âš¡ Speed**: Get working version in days, not weeks
2. **ðŸ’° Cost**: Preserve existing backend investment
3. **ðŸ§ª Validation**: Test core hypothesis with users quickly
4. **ðŸ”„ Flexibility**: Easy to migrate to any mobile framework later

### Why Flutter Second?
1. **ðŸ“± Best Mobile**: Superior single-codebase solution for 2025+
2. **ðŸŽ¨ UI Consistency**: Pixel-perfect control across all platforms
3. **âš¡ Performance**: Native-level performance on all platforms
4. **ðŸ”® Future-Proof**: Google-backed, growing ecosystem
