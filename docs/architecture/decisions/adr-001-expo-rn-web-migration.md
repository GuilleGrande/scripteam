# ADR-001: Migrate to Expo + React Native Web Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-09-21

## Context

During QA review of Story 1.1 (Basic Script Upload and Text Processing), a critical architecture deviation was identified (ARCH-001). The current implementation uses React + Vite + ShadCN/UI instead of the specified React Native + Expo + NativeBase architecture defined in `tech-stack.md`.

Quality assessment showed the implementation has strong technical execution but violates core architectural decisions, creating technical debt and preventing future mobile deployment.

## Decision

**We will migrate the current React web implementation to Expo + React Native Web + NativeBase to achieve full architectural compliance while maintaining all existing functionality.**

### Migration Rationale

1. **Architecture Compliance**: Achieves 100% alignment with specified tech stack (React Native 0.72+, Expo SDK 49+, NativeBase 3.4+)
2. **Future-Proof Design**: Enables mobile deployment with minimal additional effort (iOS/Android in 1-2 days post-migration)
3. **Preserved Investment**: Maintains all current functionality and business logic (estimated 95%+ code reuse)
4. **Better Development Experience**: Expo dev tools, OTA updates, unified testing across platforms
5. **QA Resolution**: Directly resolves ARCH-001 high-severity finding

### Technical Feasibility Assessment

**Migration Compatibility Analysis**: HIGHLY COMPATIBLE
- ✅ **TypeScript codebase**: 100% compatible with React Native
- ✅ **Component patterns**: Clean mapping from ShadCN to NativeBase
- ✅ **API integration**: Express.js backend works identically with RN
- ✅ **Business logic**: Completely separable from UI layer
- ✅ **File upload**: React Native Web supports file operations

**Estimated Migration Effort**: 4-6 development days
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium (systematic, well-planned approach)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1-2)
- Initialize Expo project with TypeScript and web support
- Install and configure NativeBase UI library
- Set up React Navigation to replace React Router
- Migrate project structure and configuration

### Phase 2: Component Migration (Day 2-4)
- Convert ShadCN components to NativeBase equivalents
- Migrate ScriptUpload component (core functionality)
- Update styling from Tailwind classes to NativeBase props
- Preserve all existing functionality and user experience

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Day 4-6)
- Verify API integration works identically
- Test file upload, PDF processing, and status polling
- Validate responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
- Run comprehensive test suite on new platform

### Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation (Day 6)
- Configure Expo web build and deployment
- Update project documentation and scripts
- Remove legacy React/Vite implementation
- Update QA gate status to resolved

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- ✅ **ARCH-001 Resolution**: Complete architectural compliance achieved
- ✅ **Mobile Readiness**: Platform-ready for iOS/Android deployment
- ✅ **Technology Alignment**: Uses exact technologies specified in tech-stack.md
- ✅ **Development Consistency**: Unified development experience across platforms
- ✅ **Future Scalability**: Easier feature development with consistent component library

### Accepted Trade-offs
- ⚠️ **Short-term Development Pause**: 4-6 days focused on migration instead of new features
- ⚠️ **Learning Curve**: Team adjustment to Expo/NativeBase development patterns
- ⚠️ **Bundle Size**: Potential minor increase in web bundle size

### Risk Mitigation
- **Systematic Approach**: Phased migration with validation at each step
- **Functionality Preservation**: All features tested before legacy removal
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep current implementation until migration fully validated
- **Documentation**: Detailed component mapping and migration guide creation

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation
- [ ] All current functionality works identically on Expo web
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] File upload and PDF processing pipeline operational
- [ ] Performance metrics within 10% of current implementation
- [ ] Bundle size within 20% of current size

### QA Resolution
- [ ] ARCH-001 marked as resolved
- [ ] All Story 1.1 acceptance criteria still pass
- [ ] Quality gate status improved from CONCERNS to PASS
- [ ] No regression in test coverage or functionality

### Future Enablement
- [ ] Expo project structure ready for mobile platform addition
- [ ] NativeBase components work consistently across web/mobile
- [ ] Shared codebase percentage >95% between platforms
