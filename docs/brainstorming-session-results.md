## Technique Sessions

### SCAMPER Method - 45 minutes

**Description:** Systematic exploration of each SCAMPER dimension to generate comprehensive feature ideas

#### Ideas Generated:

**SUBSTITUTE:**
1. Celebrity/trained AI voices instead of generic text-to-speech (using solutions like Speechify)
2. Built-in scene library for users without PDFs
3. Expanded file format support (markdown, docx) beyond PDF
4. Visual emotion cues using strategic colors
5. Word-by-word animated indicators with smooth transitions
6. Character avatars/pictures to show whose line is active
7. Subtle audio "beep" cues to signal user's turn
8. Automatic emotional context detection from stage directions and scene descriptions

**COMBINE:**
9. n8n agentic AI workflows for orchestrated script processing
10. AI orchestrator breaking down screenplay into specialized steps (character identification, voice pairing, mood analysis)
11. Cue detection focus instead of conversational AI processing
12. Script adherence scoring with percentage feedback
13. Haptic feedback combined with audio cues
14. Progressive line hiding with visual learning progression

**ADAPT:**
15. Practice scheduling with deadline-driven notifications (from fitness apps)
16. Progressive difficulty levels reducing assistance as users improve (from language learning)
17. Scene/section breaking for focused practice (from music practice)

**MODIFY:**
18. Typewriter/e-reader aesthetic for familiar script feel
19. Strategic color usage on minimal display
20. AI voice optimized for smoothness over emotional depth
21. Extensive preprocessing for seamless runtime experience
22. Cloud-first approach for PoC, security to be addressed later

**PUT TO OTHER USES:**
23. Future expansion: screenplay analysis tools for directors/casting directors

**ELIMINATE:**
24. Eliminate need for printing scripts
25. Eliminate need for practice partners

**REVERSE:**
26. User-configurable emotional tone settings
27. Randomized scene order for advanced practice rounds

#### Insights Discovered:
- Focus on rehearsal support rather than performance evaluation
- Preprocessing approach enables smoother user experience
- Visual cues can effectively replace traditional text-only scripts
- Progressive difficulty creates natural learning path
- Budget-conscious approach requires leveraging existing AI tools

#### Notable Connections:
- Visual cues + audio cues + haptic feedback = comprehensive turn signaling
- Celebrity voices + emotional configuration = customizable practice experience
- n8n workflows + preprocessing = scalable AI architecture
- Progressive difficulty + scene randomization = comprehensive skill building
