# ScripTeam Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable drama students and early-career actors to practice scenes with character-specific AI voices, eliminating the constraint of partner availability
- Create an affordable alternative to €40-80/hour private coaching sessions through AI-powered scene partner simulation
- Deliver measurable skill development through progressive difficulty systems that adapt from full script visibility to advanced "blackout mode"
- Establish ScripTeam as the leading "AI Acting Coach" category creator with 80%+ brand awareness in target demographic by Year 2
- Achieve €50K-150K revenue in Year 1 (Spain market) scaling to €500K-1.5M by Year 3 through European expansion
- Build sustainable user base of 500-1,500 active users in Year 1, reaching 5,000-15,000 users by Year 3
- Integrate with 5-10 drama schools/conservatories in Spain by end of Year 1, expanding to 25-50 institutions across EU by Year 3

### Background Context
ScripTeam addresses a fundamental practice paradox in acting education: while scene work requires interactive dialogue with partners to develop timing, emotional responses, and character dynamics, partners are rarely available when needed. Market research reveals that 40% of actors (6,000-8,000 in Spain alone) are drama students or early-career professionals who cannot afford expensive private coaching and struggle with scheduling conflicts for peer practice.

The post-COVID shift toward remote auditions and self-tape submissions has intensified the need for solo practice tools, while AI voice technology has reached sufficient quality for character simulation. Unlike existing solutions that focus on line memorization (ColdRead, Rehearsal Pro), ScripTeam creates character-specific AI voices that respond with appropriate personality, tone, and emotional calibration based on script analysis and stage directions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, actor-focused mobile experience that feels like having a professional scene partner always available. The interface should reduce friction between script upload and practice session start, emphasizing quick access to core functionality while maintaining the serious, professional tone that appeals to drama students and early-career actors.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Voice-First Interaction:** Primary interface during practice sessions relies on voice commands and audio cues rather than touch, allowing actors to focus on performance
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Interface complexity adapts to user skill level, hiding advanced features initially and revealing them as actors become more comfortable
- **Gesture-Based Session Control:** Simple swipe/tap gestures for pause, replay, and difficulty adjustment during practice without breaking immersion
- **Quick Access Patterns:** One-tap access to recent scripts and favorite practice sessions from home screen

### Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the most critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD values and goals:
- **Script Upload & Analysis Screen:** Drag-and-drop interface with real-time parsing progress and character detection results
- **Character Selection Screen:** Visual character cards showing detected roles with voice preview options
- **Practice Session Screen:** Minimal interface during active practice with script text, audio controls, and progress indicators
- **Progress Dashboard:** Visual skill progression tracking with session history and achievement milestones
- **Settings & Profile Screen:** Voice preferences, difficulty settings, and account management

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target WCAG AA compliance to support actors with visual or hearing impairments, including screen reader compatibility, high contrast options, and visual indicator alternatives for audio cues.

### Branding
Professional, modern aesthetic that conveys reliability and educational value without appearing overly corporate. Clean typography suitable for script reading, with color palette that supports extended reading sessions and reduces eye strain during practice.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on mobile devices (iOS/Android) with responsive web interface for desktop script upload and management. Progressive Web App capabilities for offline script access.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing mobile app, backend API, and AI processing services for simplified development workflow and deployment coordination under solopreneur constraints.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices within Monorepo approach:** Dedicated services for AI voice processing, script analysis, and user management that can scale independently while maintaining development simplicity. Core services include:
- **Script Analysis Service:** AI-powered parsing and character detection
- **Voice Synthesis Service:** ElevenLabs/Play.HT API integration with fallback providers
- **User Management Service:** Authentication, progress tracking, and subscription management
- **Session Orchestration Service:** Coordinates practice sessions and real-time interactions

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration testing approach:** Focus on API reliability and AI service integration testing rather than comprehensive e2e testing due to resource constraints. Critical testing areas:
- Unit tests for core business logic and data processing
- Integration tests for AI API reliability and voice synthesis quality
- Load testing for concurrent user scenarios (100 → 5,000 users)
- Manual testing convenience methods for practice session flows

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology:**
- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development (single codebase, native performance, extensive AI/audio library support)
- **Expo framework** for accelerated development and over-the-air updates

**Backend Technology:**
- **Node.js with Express** for JavaScript consistency across full stack
- **TypeScript** for enhanced code reliability and developer experience

**Database Architecture:**
- **PostgreSQL** for structured user data, progress tracking, and subscription management
- **Redis** for session caching and real-time practice state management
- **AWS S3** for encrypted script file storage with EU data residency

**AI Integration Strategy:**
- **Primary:** ElevenLabs API for premium voice synthesis
- **Backup:** Play.HT API for cost optimization and redundancy
- **Script Analysis:** OpenAI GPT-4 for character detection and emotional context parsing

**Infrastructure Choices:**
- **AWS** with auto-scaling groups for variable AI processing loads
- **EU-West data centers** for GDPR compliance and target market latency
- **CloudFront CDN** for script file distribution and mobile app performance

**Cost Management Strategy:**
- **AI API usage monitoring** with automatic scaling limits to prevent cost overruns
- **Freemium tier limitations** on AI voice generation minutes to control costs
- **Caching strategies** for repeated script analysis and voice synthesis requests
