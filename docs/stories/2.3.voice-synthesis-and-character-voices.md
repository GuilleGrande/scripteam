# Story 2.3: Voice Synthesis and Character Voices

## Status
Planned

## Story
**As a** drama student,
**I want** the system to create unique AI voices for each character in my script,
**so that** I can practice scenes with realistic AI scene partners that sound distinct from each other.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates unique voice profiles for each character based on their personality traits
2. Voice selection considers character age, gender, and personality from script analysis
3. User can preview character voices before starting practice sessions
4. Generated voices maintain consistency across different practice sessions
5. System supports both English and Spanish voice synthesis
6. Voice generation completes within 60 seconds for typical 3-5 character scripts

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Voice synthesis service integration**
  - [ ] Integrate ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 API for primary voice generation
  - [ ] Implement Play.HT Play 3.0 Mini as backup service
  - [ ] Handle API rate limits and error recovery
- [ ] **Character-to-voice mapping**
  - [ ] Algorithm to assign voice characteristics based on character traits
  - [ ] Map personality traits to voice parameters (pitch, speed, tone)
  - [ ] Handle gender and age-appropriate voice selection
- [ ] **Voice generation pipeline**
  - [ ] Process character analysis results to create voice profiles
  - [ ] Generate sample audio for voice previews
  - [ ] Cache generated voice settings for reuse
- [ ] **Voice preview interface**
  - [ ] Play character voice samples in character selection
  - [ ] Allow user to regenerate voices if unsatisfied
  - [ ] Show voice generation progress during processing
- [ ] **Multi-language support**
  - [ ] Detect script language (Spanish/English) from analysis
  - [ ] Use appropriate voice models for each language
  - [ ] Handle mixed-language scripts appropriately

## Technical Requirements
- ElevenLabs API integration with error handling
- Play.HT API as fallback service
- Voice caching system to avoid regeneration
- Support for Spain Spanish accent specifically
- Audio file storage and streaming capabilities

## Performance Requirements
- Voice generation: < 60 seconds for 5 characters
- Voice preview playback: < 2 seconds to start
- Cache hit ratio: > 80% for repeat script usage
- API fallback: < 5 seconds to switch providers

## Definition of Done
- Character selection shows voice previews for each character
- Generated voices are distinct and match character personalities
- System works for both English and Spanish scripts
- Voice generation integrates smoothly with practice session flow
- API errors are handled gracefully with fallbacks

## Dependencies
- Story 2.2: Script Analysis and Character Detection
- ElevenLabs API access and billing setup
- Play.HT API access and configuration
