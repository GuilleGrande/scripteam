# Story 1.2: Expo + React Native Web Architecture Migration

## Status
✅ Completed

## Story
**As a** technical team,
**I want** to migrate the current React web implementation to Expo + React Native Web + NativeBase,
**so that** we achieve full architectural compliance and enable future mobile deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All current functionality from Story 1.1 works identically on Expo + React Native Web platform
2. Implementation uses React Native 0.72+, Expo SDK 49+, and NativeBase 3.4+ as specified in tech-stack.md
3. TypeScript compilation works without errors on new platform
4. File upload, PDF processing, and AI workflow pipeline remain fully operational
5. Performance metrics (load time, bundle size) stay within 20% of current implementation
6. Project structure enables mobile platform addition with minimal additional effort

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis
**Source**: Story 1.1 implementation in `apps/web/`
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.0+ + Vite + ShadCN/UI
- **Key Components**: ScriptUpload, Navigation, CharacterSelection
- **API Integration**: RESTful client with file upload and polling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and animations

### Target Architecture Compliance
**Source**: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- **Frontend Framework**: React Native 0.72+ ✅
- **Mobile Platform**: Expo SDK 49+ ✅
- **UI Component Library**: NativeBase 3.4+ ✅
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ (to be added)
- **Build Tool**: Expo CLI ✅
- **Bundler**: Metro 0.76+ ✅

### Component Mapping Strategy

| **Current (ShadCN)** | **Target (NativeBase)** | **Migration Notes** |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| `Button` | `Button` | Direct mapping, same props API |
| `Card`, `CardContent` | `Box` + `shadow` | Styling approach change |
| `Progress` | `Progress` | Direct mapping |
| `Input` | `Input` | Direct mapping |
| `toast()` (Sonner) | `toast.show()` | API change, same functionality |
| Tailwind classes | NativeBase props | `className="p-4"` → `p={4}` |

### File Structure Changes

**Current Structure**:
```
apps/web/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── services/
│   └── lib/
├── package.json (Vite)
└── vite.config.ts
```

**Target Structure**:
```
apps/mobile/ (or apps/expo/)
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── services/
│   └── lib/
├── package.json (Expo)
├── app.json
└── metro.config.js
```

### API Compatibility Verification
**Backend Unchanged**: Express.js API at `apps/api/` remains identical
- ✅ POST /scripts endpoint (multipart/form-data)
- ✅ GET /scripts/:id endpoint (status polling)
- ✅ File storage and PDF processing services
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema and data models

### Performance Expectations
**Bundle Size**: Expect 10-20% increase due to React Native Web runtime
**Load Time**: Similar or better due to Expo optimizations
**Development**: Slightly slower than Vite, but Expo has improved significantly

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Parallel Development**: Keep current implementation running during migration
2. **Incremental Testing**: Validate each component migration before proceeding
3. **Rollback Plan**: Current implementation remains until full validation
4. **Component Library**: Create abstraction layer for easier future changes
