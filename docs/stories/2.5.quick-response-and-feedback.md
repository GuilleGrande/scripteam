# Story 2.5: Quick Response and Feedback System

## Status
Planned

## Story
**As a** drama student,
**I want** to receive immediate feedback on my practice sessions and quick response suggestions,
**so that** I can improve my performance and learn more effectively from each practice session.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System provides immediate feedback after each practice session
2. Feedback includes timing analysis (too fast, too slow, good pacing)
3. User receives suggestions for improvement based on their performance
4. System tracks progress over time and shows improvement trends
5. Quick response suggestions help user with forgotten lines or difficult passages
6. Feedback is constructive and encouraging to promote continued practice
7. User can review past sessions and feedback for continued learning

## Technical Requirements
- Performance analytics engine for session data analysis
- Machine learning or rule-based feedback generation
- Data visualization components for progress tracking
- Historical data storage and retrieval system
- Real-time performance monitoring during sessions

## User Experience Requirements
- Feedback feels helpful and encouraging, not critical
- Quick response features are subtle and non-intrusive
- Progress visualization is motivating and clear
- Recommendations are practical and achievable
- Interface promotes regular practice and improvement

## Performance Requirements
- Feedback generation: < 10 seconds after session completion
- Progress dashboard loads: < 3 seconds
- Historical data retrieval: < 2 seconds for 30 days of data
- Real-time analysis during practice: < 100ms latency

## Definition of Done
- Users receive constructive feedback after each practice session
- Quick response system helps users during difficult moments
- Progress tracking shows clear improvement trends over time
- Feedback system encourages continued practice and learning
- All feedback features work reliably and add value to practice experience

## Dependencies
- Story 2.4: Interactive Practice Sessions (for performance data)
- Practice session metrics and data collection
- User progress data storage system
