# Story 2.2: Script Analysis and Character Detection

## Status
Planned

## Story
**As a** drama student,
**I want** the system to automatically analyze my uploaded script and identify all characters and scenes,
**so that** I can see who's in my script and choose which character I want to practice.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System automatically detects all speaking characters from uploaded script text
2. Characters are displayed with their line count and personality traits (extracted or inferred)
3. System identifies distinct scenes or segments within the script
4. User can see character descriptions and speaking patterns
5. System handles both traditional screenplay format and stage play formats

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Character detection algorithm**
  - [ ] Parse script text to identify character names in dialogue
  - [ ] Extract character line counts and speaking frequency
  - [ ] Handle variations in script formatting (CAPS, stage directions, etc.)
- [ ] **Personality inference service**
  - [ ] Analyze character dialogue for personality traits
  - [ ] Generate character descriptions based on speaking patterns
  - [ ] Classify character types (protagonist, antagonist, comic relief, etc.)

  - [ ] Extract scene settings and context
  - [ ] Calculate estimated scene duration
- [ ] **Character display UI**

  - [ ] Show recommended characters for practice

## Technical Requirements
