## Dev Notes

### Existing Frontend Implementation
**EXCELLENT NEWS**: The frontend ScriptUpload component is already fully implemented at `apps/web/src/components/ScriptUpload.tsx` and meets most of the AC requirements:

**Completed Features**:
- ✅ Drag and drop file upload interface
- ✅ File type validation for PDF and TXT files
- ✅ Beautiful progress indication with AI processing phases
- ✅ Professional UI using ShadCN/UI components
- ✅ Proper TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Mock processing workflow simulation

**Frontend Tech Stack Used** [Source: apps/web/package.json]:
- React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- Vite build tool with SWC
- ShadCN/UI component library with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

### Shared Types Integration
**COMPLETED**: Shared types package created at `packages/shared/` with:
- Script, Character, User interfaces from architecture
- API types for requests/responses
- Processing status enums
- TypeScript definitions matching data models

### Required Backend Implementation
**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#script]:
```typescript
interface Script {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  originalText: string;
  detectedLanguage: 'es' | 'en' | 'mixed' | 'unknown';
  primaryLanguage: 'es' | 'en';
  processingStatus: ProcessingStatus;
  fileMetadata: FileMetadata;
  uploadedAt: Date;
}
```

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE scripts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    original_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    detected_language VARCHAR(10) CHECK (detected_language IN ('es', 'en', 'mixed', 'unknown')),
    primary_language VARCHAR(2) CHECK (primary_language IN ('es', 'en')),
    processing_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'uploading',
    file_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**API Endpoint Needed** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:
```
POST /scripts
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body:
  - file: binary (PDF or text file)
  - title: string (optional)
  - expectedLanguage: string (optional: 'es', 'en', 'auto')

Response 201:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "processingStatus": "uploading",
  "uploadedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

### File Locations
**Existing Structure**:
- Frontend component: ✅ `apps/web/src/components/ScriptUpload.tsx`
- Shared types: ✅ `packages/shared/src/types/script.ts`
- Mock types: `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` (to be migrated to shared package)

**Still Needed**:
- Backend API: `apps/api/src/routes/scripts.ts`
- Database models: `apps/api/src/models/Script.ts`
- PDF extraction service: `apps/api/src/services/pdfExtractor.ts`
- File storage service: `apps/api/src/services/fileStorage.ts`

### Frontend Improvements Needed
1. **File Size Validation**: Add 10MB limit check in `handleFileSelection()`
2. **Error Handling**: Replace `alert()` with toast notifications (Sonner is already installed)
3. **API Integration**: Connect to real backend endpoints instead of mock processing
4. **Type Migration**: Update to use shared types from `@scripteam/shared`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: ✅ React + TypeScript (using latest versions)
- UI Framework: ✅ Using ShadCN/UI (equivalent to NativeBase for web)
- Backend needed: Node.js with Express.js 4.18+, TypeScript 5.0+
- Database needed: PostgreSQL 15+ with proper indexing
- File Handling: Need multer middleware for Express

### Testing
**Testing Standards**:
- **Frontend testing**: Use Jest + React Testing Library (need to set up)
- **Backend testing**: Use Jest + Supertest for API endpoints (need to set up)

**Specific Test Scenarios**:

**Frontend Component Tests**:
- File selection via drag-and-drop with valid PDF
- File selection via click with valid TXT file
- File size validation: reject files >10MB with proper error message
- File type validation: reject .docx, .jpg files with clear feedback
- Progress indicator displays during mock processing
- Error handling: display toast notification instead of alert()

**Backend API Tests**:
- POST /scripts with valid PDF file returns 201 with script metadata
- POST /scripts with valid TXT file processes and stores correctly
- POST /scripts with >10MB file returns 413 payload too large
- POST /scripts with unsupported file type returns 400 bad request
- POST /scripts with corrupted PDF file returns 422 unprocessable entity

**PDF Text Extraction Tests**:
- Standard Fountain format script extracts character names and dialogue
- Traditional screenplay format (Final Draft export) processes correctly
- PDF with mixed English/Spanish dialogue maintains language detection
- PDF with non-standard formatting (stage play format) extracts readable text
- Corrupted PDF file fails gracefully with specific error message

**Database Persistence Tests**:
- Script record created with correct user association
- Original text stored with proper encoding (UTF-8)
- File metadata JSON contains size, type, and upload timestamp
- Processing status updates correctly through workflow stages

**Error Handling Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end file upload with network interruption
- Database connection failure during script save
- File storage service unavailable scenario
- Memory exhaustion with very large (but <10MB) files

### Next Steps Priority
1. **HIGH**: Set up backend API structure (`apps/api/`)
2. **HIGH**: Implement POST /scripts endpoint with file upload
3. **MEDIUM**: Add file size validation to frontend component
4. **MEDIUM**: Replace alert() with proper toast notifications
5. **LOW**: Migrate frontend types to use `@scripteam/shared`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality**: The technical implementation demonstrates solid full-stack development with good separation of concerns, proper TypeScript usage, and comprehensive file upload functionality. The codebase follows modern React/Express patterns with appropriate error handling and user experience considerations.

**Critical Concerns Identified**: This implementation has **significant architectural and testing gaps** that prevent production readiness. While the core functionality appears complete, the absence of any test coverage and deviation from specified architecture creates substantial risk.

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage Gaps**:
- **AC1 (File Upload)**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Web interface with drag-and-drop, file validation
- **AC2 (PDF Extraction)**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - 95%+ accuracy with format validation
- **AC3 (Secure Storage)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Storage implemented, confirmation display missing
- **AC4 (Error Handling)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Basic validation present, needs enhancement
- **AC5 (File Size Limit)**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - 10MB limit enforced frontend/backend

**CRITICAL GAP**: Zero test coverage means AC validation is entirely manual and unverified.

### Architecture Compliance Review

❌ **MAJOR DEVIATION**: Implementation uses React web stack instead of specified React Native + NativeBase architecture from tech-stack.md:
- **Expected**: React Native 0.72+, NativeBase 3.4+, mobile-first design
- **Actual**: React 18.3.1, ShadCN/UI, Vite web build
- **Impact**: Violates architectural decisions, creates technical debt

✅ **Compliant Elements**:
- TypeScript 5.0+ usage throughout
- Express.js 4.18+ backend
- PostgreSQL 15+ with proper schema design
- Proper file handling with multer

### Technical Debt Identification

**High Priority Issues**:
1. **Testing Debt**: Complete absence of test coverage (Jest/Supertest configured but unused)
2. **Architecture Debt**: Web implementation vs. mobile architecture specification
3. **Security Debt**: File validation needs hardening, missing security headers
4. **Reliability Debt**: Database fallback logic incomplete, transaction handling missing

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security**: 🟡 **CONCERNS**
- File type validation present but basic
- Missing security headers (helmet configured but needs tuning)
- No rate limiting on upload endpoints
- PDF parsing library needs security audit

**Performance**: 🟡 **CONCERNS**
- Polling-based status checking (2s intervals) may impact UX
- No file compression or optimization
- Missing performance monitoring
- Database connection pooling properly configured

**Reliability**: 🔴 **FAIL**
- Database fallback to in-memory storage creates data inconsistency risk
- No transaction handling for multi-step operations
- Error recovery mechanisms incomplete
- Missing health checks and monitoring

**Maintainability**: 🟡 **CONCERNS**
- Good code structure and TypeScript usage
- Missing comprehensive documentation
- No test coverage severely impacts maintainability
- Good separation of concerns in service layer
