# Story 2.4: Interactive Practice Sessions

## Status
Planned

## Story
**As a** drama student,
**I want** to practice scenes interactively with AI character voices and quick response capabilities,
**so that** I can improve my acting skills through realistic scene practice with immediate feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can start a practice session after selecting their character
2. AI voices deliver other characters' lines with appropriate timing and emotion
3. System provides visual cues for when to speak (user's turn)
4. User can respond naturally and the system adapts to their pacing
5. Session includes pause/resume functionality for practice control
6. System tracks practice metrics (timing, participation, session length)
7. User can restart scenes or jump to specific dialogue sections
