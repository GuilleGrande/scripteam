# Sprint Change Proposal: Epic-Story Alignment Post ADR-002

**Date:** 2025-09-26
**Prepared by:** Sarah (Product Owner)
**Change Analysis:** Complete
**Recommendation:** Approved for Implementation

## Executive Summary

### Identified Issue Summary
Epic-story misalignments caused by ADR-002 (React Web PoC Pivot) created documentation drift between Epic List (accurate web-first strategy) and individual Epic files (outdated mobile-first approach), resulting in:
- Epic-story numbering inconsistencies blocking planning decisions
- Developer confusion about current vs planned implementation
- Missing epic files preventing complete project roadmap visibility
- Documentation debt hampering team productivity

### Epic Impact Summary
**Current State:** Epic structure viable but content misaligned
- Epic 1 & 2: Files contain mobile-first content but Epic List shows web-first
- Epic 3-6: Missing files prevent complete roadmap understanding
- Stories 2.3-2.6: Already exist and align with web strategy

**Resolution:** Update existing Epic files and create missing Epic files to match Epic List strategy

### Artifact Adjustment Needs
1. **Epic 1 File:** Update for web-first approach with Phase 1/2 strategy
2. **Epic 2 File:** Complete rewrite for web PoC enhancement vs mobile foundation
3. **Epic 3-6 Files:** Create missing files based on Epic List content
4. **Architecture Documents:** Update tech stack references (future task)

### Recommended Path Forward
**Direct Adjustment/Integration** - Systematic documentation updates to align with approved ADR-002 web-first strategy, preserving all technical work while eliminating epic-story confusion.

### PRD MVP Impact
**No scope changes required** - Core value proposition unchanged, Phase 1 timeline may extend slightly for documentation alignment but business objectives remain intact.

## Specific Proposed Edits

### 1. Epic 1 File Update
**File:** `docs/prd/epic-1-ai-voice-proof-of-concept-core-value-validation.md`

**Action:** Replace with `epic-1-ai-voice-proof-of-concept-core-value-validation-PROPOSED.md`

**Key Changes:**
- Epic Goal updated for web-based PoC focus
- Added Phase 1 Strategy section explaining web → mobile migration path
- Updated Story 1.4 for web-based scene practice
- Added Epic Success Criteria emphasizing cross-browser compatibility
- Updated Story 1.5 for web interface vs mobile app interface

### 2. Epic 2 File Complete Rewrite
**File:** `docs/prd/epic-2-mobile-app-foundation-session-management.md`

**Action:** Replace with `epic-2-web-poc-enhanced-user-experience-PROPOSED.md`

**Key Changes:**
- **FROM:** "Mobile App Foundation & Session Management"
- **TO:** "Web PoC - Enhanced User Experience"
- Complete content rewrite focusing on web experience enhancement
- Stories updated to web-specific features (2.4-2.8)
- Added mobile migration preparation context
- Success criteria focused on user engagement and feedback collection

### 3. New Epic Files Created
**Files Created:**
- `docs/prd/epic-3-flutter-migration-mobile-foundation.md`
- `docs/prd/epic-4-mobile-enhancement-advanced-features.md`
- `docs/prd/epic-5-progressive-learning-user-retention.md`
- `docs/prd/epic-6-scale-monetization-production-readiness.md`

**Content:** Based on Epic List specifications with detailed stories and acceptance criteria for Phase 2 mobile development

### 4. Story Files Status
**Verified Existing:** Stories 2.3-2.6 already exist and align with web-first strategy
- Story 2.3: Voice Synthesis and Character Voices ✅
- Story 2.4: Interactive Practice Sessions ✅
- Story 2.5: Quick Response and Feedback System ✅
- Story 2.6: Development Quick Start Guide ✅

**No new story files required**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Replace Epic 1 File** - Deploy updated Epic 1 with web-first content
2. **Replace Epic 2 File** - Deploy updated Epic 2 focusing on web enhancement
3. **Verify Story Alignment** - Confirm Stories 2.3-2.6 align with updated epics
4. **Update Epic List References** - Ensure Epic List correctly points to updated files

### Phase 2: Documentation Completion (Next Week)
1. **Architecture Document Updates** - Update tech stack sections for React Web + Flutter path
2. **Frontend Specification Updates** - Align with React Web + ShadCN/UI implementation
3. **Deployment Documentation** - Add web hosting configuration guidance

### Phase 3: Validation (Following Week)
1. **Cross-Reference Validation** - Verify all epic-story references align
2. **Developer Onboarding Test** - Validate new team member can follow updated documentation
3. **Stakeholder Review** - Confirm business stakeholders understand Phase 1/2 strategy

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success Indicators
- [ ] Epic List and individual Epic files content aligned
- [ ] All Epic 1-6 files exist and accessible
- [ ] Story numbering consistency achieved
- [ ] No broken references between epics and stories

### Medium-term Validation
- [ ] New developers can onboard using updated documentation
- [ ] Project planning decisions no longer blocked by epic-story confusion
- [ ] Phase 1 (Web PoC) vs Phase 2 (Mobile) strategy clear to all stakeholders
- [ ] Technical implementation proceeds without documentation blockers

## Risk Mitigation

### Implementation Risks
- **Risk:** File replacement breaks existing references
- **Mitigation:** Use `-PROPOSED` files for review before replacement
- **Risk:** Content gaps discovered during implementation
- **Mitigation:** Incremental validation with development team

### Communication Risks
- **Risk:** Stakeholders confused by documentation changes
- **Mitigation:** Clear communication about ADR-002 rationale and Phase 1/2 strategy
- **Risk:** Team members reference outdated files
- **Mitigation:** Git commit messages clearly indicate epic file updates

## Agent Handoff Plan

### Immediate Handoff (Product Owner)
- **Action:** Deploy updated Epic files after final review approval
- **Timeline:** Complete within 2 business days
- **Deliverable:** Updated epic-story alignment eliminating documentation drift

### Future Handoff (Development Team)
- **Action:** Use updated Epic files for Sprint planning and story implementation
- **Dependencies:** Updated Epic files deployed and validated
- **Support:** PO available for clarification on updated content

### Architecture Handoff (Future)
- **Action:** Update architecture documents for React Web + Flutter strategy
- **Timeline:** Following Epic file deployment
- **Scope:** Tech stack sections, component diagrams, deployment strategies
